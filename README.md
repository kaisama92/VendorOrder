#### By _**Kai Clausen**_

#### _This application will allow Pierre to keep track of his vendor and orders. (Practice Project)_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _C#/.Net_
* _MySQL_

## Description

_This application was created for independent review. This application on start up will take the user to a splash page with a link that takes them to the vendor list page, where vendors, if there are any, will be displayed. The user will have an opportunity to add a new vendor and after they fill out the form they will be redirected to the vendor list page. If they click on any of the vendors, they will be directed to that vendors page, where they will be able to see any orders that have been placed. They can either click on the order to see the order details, or they can create a new order. _
